UserAnime {"Naruto":{"a_name":"Naruto","desc":"Naruto closely follows the life of a boy who is feared and detested by the villagers of the hidden leaf village of Konoha. The distrust of the boy has little to do with the boy himself, but it’s what’s inside him that causes anxiety. Long before Naruto came to be, a Kyuubi (demon fox) with great fury and power waged war taking many lives. The battle ensued for a long time until a man known as the Fourth Hokage, Yondaime, the strongest ninja in Konoha, fiercely fought the Kyuubi. The fight was soon won by Yondaime as he sealed the evil demon in a human body. Thus the boy, Naruto, was born. As Naruto grows he decides to become the strongest ninja in Konoha in an effort to show everyone that he is not as they perceive him to be, but is a human being worthy of love and admiration. But the road to becoming Hokage, the title for the strongest ninja in Konoha, is a long and arduous one. It is a path filled with betrayal, pain, and loss; but with hard work, Naruto may achieve Hokage.","ppl":"\nDirector : Hayato Date\nScript : Michiko Yokote\nScript : Junki Takegami\nScript : Satoru Nishizono\nScript : Katsuyuki Sumisawa\nScript : Shin Yoshida\nScript : Yasuyuki Suzuki\nScript : Akatsuki Yamatoya\nScript : Yuka Miyata\nScript : Kou Hei Mushi\nStoryboard : Tetsuro Amino\nStoryboard : Hidehito Ueda\nStoryboard : Toshiya Niidome\nStoryboard : Kazumi Kobayashi\nStoryboard : Ryo Yasumura\nStoryboard : Koji Masunari\nStoryboard : Masahiko Murata\nStoryboard : Tokuyuki Matsutake\nStoryboard : Hirofumi Suzuki\nStoryboard : Yasunori Urata\nStoryboard : Hitoyuki Matsui\nStoryboard : Shigenori Kageyama\nStoryboard : Shinji Satoh\nStoryboard : Takaaki Ishiyama\nStoryboard : Masaaki Kumagai\nStoryboard : Tetsuji Takayanagi\nStoryboard : Hayato Date\nStoryboard : Yuichiro Miyake\nStoryboard : Noriyoshi Nakamura\nStoryboard : Yasuhiro Minami\nStoryboard : Satoru Iriyoshi\nStoryboard : Yuki Kinoshita\nStoryboard : Rion Kujo\nStoryboard : Toshiyuki Tsuru\nStoryboard : Chiyuki Tanaka\nStoryboard : Takafumi Hayashi\nStoryboard : Hiroshi Kimura\nStoryboard : Junya Koshiba\nStoryboard : Atsushi Wakabayashi\nStoryboard : Atsushi Nigorikawa\nStoryboard : Mitsutaka Noshitani\nStoryboard : Yuu Yamashita\nStoryboard : Takeyuki Sadohara\nStoryboard : Toshiyuki Shimazu\nStoryboard : Yasuaki Kurotsu\nStoryboard : Hiroki Kawashima\nStoryboard : Mashu Itō\nStoryboard : Kei Jūmonji\nStoryboard : Tsubute Hyakuno\nStoryboard : Hayauma Ippaku\nStoryboard : Yuki Hayashi\nStoryboard : Mamoru Sasaki\nStoryboard : Seiji Okuda\nStoryboard : Tsuyoshi Matsumoto\nEpisode Director : Kyosuke Mikuriya\nEpisode Director : Yoshihiro Sugai\nEpisode Director : Toshiya Niidome\nEpisode Director : Kazuyoshi Yokota\nEpisode Director : Masahiko Murata\nEpisode Director : Yasunori Urata\nEpisode Director : Shigenori Kageyama\nEpisode Director : Shinji Satoh\nEpisode Director : Masaaki Kumagai\nEpisode Director : Hayato Date\nEpisode Director : Akira Shimizu\nEpisode Director : Yuki Kinoshita\nEpisode Director : Rion Kujo\nEpisode Director : Toshiyuki Tsuru\nEpisode Director : Chiyuki Tanaka\nEpisode Director : Hiroshi Kimura\nEpisode Director : Yukio Okazaki\nEpisode Director : Hayato Goda\nEpisode Director : Atsushi Wakabayashi\nEpisode Director : Atsushi Nigorikawa\nEpisode Director : Masayuki Iimura\nEpisode Director : Mitsutaka Noshitani\nEpisode Director : Shuuji Miyahara\nEpisode Director : Keiichiro Kawaguchi\nEpisode Director : Yasuyuki Honda\nEpisode Director : Takeyuki Sadohara\nEpisode Director : Mashu Itō\nEpisode Director : Kiyomu Fukuda\nEpisode Director : Yuki Hayashi\nEpisode Director : Tsuyoshi Matsumoto\nUnit Director : Tokuyuki Matsutake\nUnit Director : Hirofumi Suzuki\nUnit Director : Rion Kujo\nUnit Director : Toshiyuki Tsuru\nUnit Director : Yuu Yamashita\nMusic : Toshio Masuda\nMusic : Musashi Project\nOriginal Manga : Masashi Kishimoto\nCharacter Design : Tetsuya Nishio\nCharacter Design : Hirofumi Suzuki\nArt Director : Shigenori Takada\nArt : Kazuhiko Suzuki\nArt : Shigenori Takada\nArt : Tomoyuki Shimizu\nArt : Michiko Taniguchi\nArt : Shinji Sugiyama\nAnimation Director : Yuji Moriyama\nAnimation Director : Akira Matsushima\nAnimation Director : Yukiko Ban\nAnimation Director : Tokuyuki Matsutake\nAnimation Director : Hirofumi Suzuki\nAnimation Director : Shinichi Suzuki\nAnimation Director : Atsushi Aono\nAnimation Director : Yukimaro Ohtsubo\nAnimation Director : Takeshi Ozaka\nAnimation Director : Haruo Sotozaki\nAnimation Director : Hiromi Okazaki\nAnimation Director : Hideki Hashimoto\nAnimation Director : Chiyuki Tanaka\nAnimation Director : Takenori Tsukuma\nAnimation Director : Masaru Hyodo\nAnimation Director : Chikara Sakurai\nAnimation Director : Takako Onishi\nAnimation Director : Mariko Aoki\nAnimation Director : Kazuya Saitoh\nAnimation Director : Minoru Morita\nAnimation Director : Masafumi Yamamoto\nAnimation Director : Kenichiro Ogata\nAnimation Director : Atsushi Wakabayashi\nAnimation Director : Naoki Aisaka\nAnimation Director : Hideyuki Yoshida\nAnimation Director : Hidehiko Okano\nAnimation Director : Seiko Asai\nAnimation Director : Kumiko Horikoshi\nAnimation Director : Akihiro Tsuda\nAnimation Director : Marie Tagashira\nAnimation Director : Yasuhiko Kanezuka\nAnimation Director : Gorou Sessha\nAnimation Director : Zenjirou Ukulele\nAnimation Director : Kazuhisa Kosuga\nAnimation Director : Choi Jong Gi\nSound Director : Yasunori Ebina\nDirector of Photography : Atsuho Matsumoto\nProducer : Noriko Kobayashi\nProducer : Tomoko Gushima\nProducer : Ken Hagino\nProducer : Hiroshi Hagino","userRating":"8","a_genres":["action","comedy","drama","fantasy","tournament"]},"Bleach":{"a_name":"Bleach","desc":"Ichigo Kurosaki is a 15-year-old-boy who has an ability to see ghosts/spirits.
