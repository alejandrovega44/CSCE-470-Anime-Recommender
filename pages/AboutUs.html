					<p>
						Nicolas & Alejandro are both Computer Science Majors at Texas A&M University. So why did we chose to do this sort of recommender? We decided to do this is recommeder for two reasons, first being this is our final project for our CSCE-470 Information Storage and Retrieval course. The second reason we are doing this recommder is due to our interest in anime. With this recommender we aim to introduce provide anime enthusiasts with fresh animes with upcoming seasons. You might have to wait a little before you'll get to watch that new season but at least you know about it!
